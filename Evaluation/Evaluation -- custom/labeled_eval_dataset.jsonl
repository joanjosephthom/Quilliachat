University education is of strategic importance for our region and our country and is fundamental to society’s intellectual and professional growth. The Italian Constitution states that ‘school is open to everyone’ and it is the task of the Republic to remove economic and social obstacles, which, by limiting the freedom and equality of citizens, prevent the full development of the individual. The universal right to education, enshrined in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is one of the pillars of the Republic. Promoting university study also means growing the national economy. Today, universities play a particularly strategic role, not least because of the dynamics inherent in skills training and knowledge development, which are decisive factors in an advanced, industrialised country such as ours. For all these reasons, we are committed to making the university system more attractive and to supporting as many students as possible who wish to further their education at a university in our region. Facilitating access to and the exercise of this right through support measures, and activating adequate economic support and providing welcome areas are tasks that the writer is called upon to honour with the greatest commitment. In pursuit of these objectives, we want to continue the path of fruitful cooperation and discussion already under way with student representatives, with the common aim of improving and implementing services that allow for the right to study to be exercised in full. In consideration of the comments and proposals in our meeting, we have, for example, reduced the amount required for the security deposit, focusing on the responsible management of a common good. We have also increased to 10% the rise in the scholarship recognised by Ministerial Decree 1320/2021 for students with disability grade of at least 66%, or with a recognised disability under Article 3, paragraph 3 of Law 104/92. Furthermore, as of the 2024/2025 academic year, the scholarship will be paid partly through a monetary payment and partly through services, simultaneously granting, regardless of the status of the Beneficiary or Eligible Non-Recipient, a free daily meal for 10 months, to be consumed at DiSCo canteens. Nevertheless, it will be possible to monetise the fee in services in the event that the student is enrolled in a course taking place in Rome, or in a municipality of the Lazio region where the canteens are not managed by DiSCo. We are certain, however, that we can still improve the services offered: our hope is that the opportunities offered by the new call for applications will help many young people to study at our region's universities and achieve the desired results. Dear students, always remember that study is the only tool we have to climb over the wall of ignorance. Education means independence, freedom of thought and the ability to exchange views with others. With this in mind, and as Albert Einstein once said, never consider study as a duty, but as an enviable opportunity. Hon. Prof. Luisa Regimenti Councillor for the University Dear Students, In 2024 DiSCo once again continues its efforts to improve its services and to streamline the procedures for participation in the call for applications for the right to study, so as to guarantee this right to as many students as possible. This is a concrete commitment by DiSCo, which, thanks also to the use of resources from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and the European Social Fund, made it possible to award more than 35,000 scholarships last year alone, thereby eliminating the figure of the Eligible Non- Recipient. Such results are the fruit of the commitment of those who have worked on the procedures for planning, designing, executing and reporting on scholarships, the main instrument through which the ‘right to study’ has come about. A right that, as now recognised, is little more than a century old with its current meaning and with the responsibilities of the state in this area. A right where today, and more so than in the past, language must be used that, whilst remaining within the framework of legal terminology, is in step with the times. Using language as a starting point, it is possible to reconstruct, for instance, the history of the scholarship institution. A history that goes back to the Middle Ages where one could find initiatives for the ‘outsider students and their stay’. As you can see, already from the words used (‘outsider’) it is clear how distant the current set-up is from the historical one. Compared to other European countries, Italy was late in providing benefits to deserving and needy students. Even in the 19th century, there was a belief that it was not the state, but ‘society’ that should take care of education and the organisation of the school system. The era of university being seen as an elitist institution now seems ancient history. Again, the language used indicates the signs of time. Just think that it was not until the 1920s and 1930s that the 'Opere universitarie' and 'Casse scolastiche’ came into being. Here we come to the rules found in the Constitution of the Italian Republic, where we find the roots of the right to university study as we know them today. In fact, the second paragraph of Article 3 entrusts the Republic with the task of removing economic and social obstacles that, by effectively limiting the freedom and equality of citizens, prevent the full development of the individual and the participation of all workers in the political, economic and social organisation of the country. Article 34, paragraphs 3 and 4, provides that the able and deserving, even if deprived of means, have the right to attain the highest levels of education and states that the Republic must render this right effective through scholarships and family allowances, as well as other provisions to be allotted via a competitive exam. This story is the starting point and premise for the call for applications for the 2024/2025 academic year, which is largely in line with the previous academic year, but there are some significant elements of diversification and further initiatives to improve communication.  Similar to what has already been implemented by the main bodies for the right to university studies for some time, as of the academic year 2024/2025, the scholarship will be paid to you partly through a monetary payment and partly through services, simultaneously granting, regardless of your status as a Beneficiary or Eligible Non- Recipient, a free daily meal for 10 months, to be consumed at DiSCo canteens. Nevertheless, it will be possible to monetise the fee in services in the event that the student is enrolled in a course taking place in Rome, or in a municipality of the Lazio region where the canteens are not managed by DiSCo;  Although the rules for participation have not substantially changed, should the student apply for accommodation, they must pay special attention to complying with the deadlines outlined in the call for applications. In order to be able to anticipate the allocation of accommodation places, the deadlines by which students applying for accommodation must finalise their competition position have been brought forward;  In order to facilitate access to accommodation places, accepting the Council's proposals, the security deposit amount has been reduced, focusing on the responsible management of a common good;  The call for applications includes the revaluation of the cost of accommodation services related to university residences, adjusting the amounts in compliance with current regulations and differentiating it according to the characteristics of the structure, especially in relation to the usability of the cafeteria service,  Exercising a power provided for by law, DiSCo raised to 10% the scholarship increase recognised by Ministerial Decree 1320/2021 in favour of students with a disability of at least 66% or with a recognised handicap pursuant to Article 3 paragraph 3 of Law 104/92. As every year, you are asked to read the notice and carefully fill in the online application, and to this end, a series of guides have been prepared which are available at www.laziodisco.it, the website dedicated to of the call for applications. This is a support tool to help prevent errors during the completion of the application that may deprive the student of an opportunity such as a scholarship or an accommodation place. As resources are not unlimited, these are all useful tools for exercising a right that is provided for those who want to access a first academic degree (unfortunately, it is not possible to finance a second degree of the same grade, even if acquired abroad). In summary, DiSCo continues in its efforts to simplify procedures and improve the language; nevertheless, this cannot take the place of the traditional but heartfelt wish for success with your studies.

Through this Call for applications, DiSCo regulates access to the benefits for the academic year 2024/2025. Benefits may be requested yearly, until the highest level of university education is attained. Benefits cannot be requested while the student is obtaining a second degree of the same cycle as the one already achieved (e.g. a double three-year degree.) Benefits are awarded by calculating and combining elements such as the applicant’s income and merit. Specific categories of students may benefit from facilitations and exemptions, such as students with disabilities of no less than 66%. Support for filling in the application form DiSCo provides various operational and informative tools, making up a system of constantly updated rules and procedures that can be found on the Call for Applications’ webpage at www.laziodisco.it. The presence of explanatory/support resources in the call for applications is flagged through symbols. An example of this is the command “see video” identified by the following icon: “ ” which indicates the requirement to watch a video. The videos and other materials to understand and read the call for applications will be active also on the online application form. However, the text of the call for applications is the only complete and correct guide to submit applications.

Double enrolment Students for the 2024/2025 academic year who have enrolled in two courses at the same time1 may benefit from the conditions and services promoting the right to study only for one of the two courses taken at a University with legal headquarters in the Lazio Region. Such enrolment must be indicated in the online application. For the second course, a higher scholarship amount is envisaged, as per Art. 8 of the call for applications. A student with one or more careers already started may apply for a scholarship, indicating the earliest enrolment date or, in case of enrolment to courses of different levels, the enrolment 1 Pursuant to L 33/2022 7 date of the higher course of studies.

The scholarships granted by DiSCo are incompatible with scholarships and/or other benefits for the right to study, that are awarded by other public and private bodies/ entities, including those assigned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and merit-based scholarships allocated by Universities (e.g.: Wanted the Best, Don't Miss Your Chance etc.). The scholarships granted by DiSCo are incompatible with scholarships, research grants or other benefits awarded to PhD students by the university, or other Institutions. Should students be awarded another scholarship/benefit for the academic year 2024/2025, they may maintain the benefits provided by DiSCo by opening a ticket and producing the waiver presented to the other institution that granted the incompatible benefit before 10 February 2025, as well as the documentation certifying the repayment of any amounts already received. Art.6 Duration of benefits With regards to the type of course of studies, the benefits may be required from the year of first enrolment:  Throughout the legal duration of the courses plus a semester in case of enrolment in a first- or second-year degree, or single-cycle Master’s degree, including music and art degrees AFAM under the post-1999/ “new” system; plus an additional semester only for the accommodation service;  Throughout the legal duration of the courses, in case of enrolment in a PhD. Beneficiaries of scholarships under MD n. 224/1999 or of other contributions from universities or other public or private institutions are excluded;  Throughout the legal duration of the courses, in case of enrolment in a PhD. Beneficiaries of scholarships under MD n. 368/1999 or of other contributions from universities or other public or private institutions are excluded. This call for applications contains the following exemptions: a) Students with disabilities. As per Art. 2, Letter f, benefit from two additional semesters in terms of duration of the benefit, as set forth for the cases contemplated in this call for 8 applications. In addition, such students are awarded a 10% increase of the scholarship amount compared to other students. b) Students with a three-year degree who enrol in a single-cycle degree course. Students with a first-cycle three-year or bachelor’s degree who enrol in a single- cycle degree are eligible for these benefits only starting from the 4th year and for the remaining years admissible to complete the single-cycle degree. The year of first enrolment should be calculated from the first year of enrolment, minus the legal duration of the three-year degree obtained. Students with a degree obtained abroad. Students in possession of a foreign university degree, even if it relates to a university based in Italy, are required, under penalty of forfeiture of benefits, to declare their possession in the application form and may only take advantage of benefits for the right to study for the level of study subsequent to that recognised in Italy for the foreign degree already obtained. DiSCo reserves the right to request, even after the publication of the final results, the official documentation (Academic Recognition, CIMEA certificate or ARDI certificate,"], "answer_snippet": "to remove economic and social obstacles, which, by limiting the freedom and equality of citizens, prevent the full development of the individual"}

University education is of strategic importance for our region and our country and is fundamental to society’s intellectual and professional growth. The Italian Constitution states that ‘school is open to everyone’ and it is the task of the Republic to remove economic and social obstacles, which, by limiting the freedom and equality of citizens, prevent the full development of the individual. The universal right to education, enshrined in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is one of the pillars of the Republic. Promoting university study also means growing the national economy. Today, universities play a particularly strategic role, not least because of the dynamics inherent in skills training and knowledge development, which are decisive factors in an advanced, industrialised country such as ours. For all these reasons, we are committed to making the university system more attractive and to supporting as many students as possible who wish to further their education at a university in our region. Facilitating access to and the exercise of this right through support measures, and activating adequate economic support and providing welcome areas are tasks that the writer is called upon to honour with the greatest commitment. In pursuit of these objectives, we want to continue the path of fruitful cooperation and discussion already under way with student representatives, with the common aim of improving and implementing services that allow for the right to study to be exercised in full. In consideration of the comments and proposals in our meeting, we have, for example, reduced the amount required for the security deposit, focusing on the responsible management of a common good. We have also increased to 10% the rise in the scholarship recognised by Ministerial Decree 1320/2021 for students with disability grade of at least 66%, or with a recognised disability under Article 3, paragraph 3 of Law 104/92. Furthermore, as of the 2024/2025 academic year, the scholarship will be paid partly through a monetary payment and partly through services, simultaneously granting, regardless of the status of the Beneficiary or Eligible Non-Recipient, a free daily meal for 10 months, to be consumed at DiSCo canteens. Nevertheless, it will be possible to monetise the fee in services in the event that the student is enrolled in a course taking place in Rome, or in a municipality of the Lazio region where the canteens are not managed by DiSCo. We are certain, however, that we can still improve the services offered: our hope is that the opportunities offered by the new call for applications will help many young people to study at our region's universities and achieve the desired results. Dear students, always remember that study is the only tool we have to climb over the wall of ignorance. Education means independence, freedom of thought and the ability to exchange views with others. With this in mind, and as Albert Einstein once said, never consider study as a duty, but as an enviable opportunity. Hon. Prof. Luisa Regimenti Councillor for the University Dear Students, In 2024 DiSCo once again continues its efforts to improve its services and to streamline the procedures for participation in the call for applications for the right to study, so as to guarantee this right to as many students as possible. This is a concrete commitment by DiSCo, which, thanks also to the use of resources from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and the European Social Fund, made it possible to award more than 35,000 scholarships last year alone, thereby eliminating the figure of the Eligible Non- Recipient. Such results are the fruit of the commitment of those who have worked on the procedures for planning, designing, executing and reporting on scholarships, the main instrument through which the ‘right to study’ has come about. A right that, as now recognised, is little more than a century old with its current meaning and with the responsibilities of the state in this area. A right where today, and more so than in the past, language must be used that, whilst remaining within the framework of legal terminology, is in step with the times. Using language as a starting point, it is possible to reconstruct, for instance, the history of the scholarship institution. A history that goes back to the Middle Ages where one could find initiatives for the ‘outsider students and their stay’. As you can see, already from the words used (‘outsider’) it is clear how distant the current set-up is from the historical one. Compared to other European countries, Italy was late in providing benefits to deserving and needy students. Even in the 19th century, there was a belief that it was not the state, but ‘society’ that should take care of education and the organisation of the school system. The era of university being seen as an elitist institution now seems ancient history. Again, the language used indicates the signs of time. Just think that it was not until the 1920s and 1930s that the 'Opere universitarie' and 'Casse scolastiche’ came into being. Here we come to the rules found in the Constitution of the Italian Republic, where we find the roots of the right to university study as we know them today. In fact, the second paragraph of Article 3 entrusts the Republic with the task of removing economic and social obstacles that, by effectively limiting the freedom and equality of citizens, prevent the full development of the individual and the participation of all workers in the political, economic and social organisation of the country. Article 34, paragraphs 3 and 4, provides that the able and deserving, even if deprived of means, have the right to attain the highest levels of education and states that the Republic must render this right effective through scholarships and family allowances, as well as other provisions to be allotted via a competitive exam. This story is the starting point and premise for the call for applications for the 2024/2025 academic year, which is largely in line with the previous academic year, but there are some significant elements of diversification and further initiatives to improve communication.  Similar to what has already been implemented by the main bodies for the right to university studies for some time, as of the academic year 2024/2025, the scholarship will be paid to you partly through a monetary payment and partly through services, simultaneously granting, regardless of your status as a Beneficiary or Eligible Non- Recipient, a free daily meal for 10 months, to be consumed at DiSCo canteens. Nevertheless, it will be possible to monetise the fee in services in the event that the student is enrolled in a course taking place in Rome, or in a municipality of the Lazio region where the canteens are not managed by DiSCo;  Although the rules for participation have not substantially changed, should the student apply for accommodation, they must pay special attention to complying with the deadlines outlined in the call for applications. In order to be able to anticipate the allocation of accommodation places, the deadlines by which students applying for accommodation must finalise their competition position have been brought forward;  In order to facilitate access to accommodation places, accepting the Council's proposals, the security deposit amount has been reduced, focusing on the responsible management of a common good;  The call for applications includes the revaluation of the cost of accommodation services related to university residences, adjusting the amounts in compliance with current regulations and differentiating it according to the characteristics of the structure, especially in relation to the usability of the cafeteria service,  Exercising a power provided for by law, DiSCo raised to 10% the scholarship increase recognised by Ministerial Decree 1320/2021 in favour of students with a disability of at least 66% or with a recognised handicap pursuant to Article 3 paragraph 3 of Law 104/92. As every year, you are asked to read the notice and carefully fill in the online application, and to this end, a series of guides have been prepared which are available at www.laziodisco.it, the website dedicated to of the call for applications. This is a support tool to help prevent errors during the completion of the application that may deprive the student of an opportunity such as a scholarship or an accommodation place. As resources are not unlimited, these are all useful tools for exercising a right that is provided for those who want to access a first academic degree (unfortunately, it is not possible to finance a second degree of the same grade, even if acquired abroad). In summary, DiSCo continues in its efforts to simplify procedures and improve the language; nevertheless, this cannot take the place of the traditional but heartfelt wish for success with your studies.

Through this Call for applications, DiSCo regulates access to the benefits for the academic year 2024/2025. Benefits may be requested yearly, until the highest level of university education is attained. Benefits cannot be requested while the student is obtaining a second degree of the same cycle as the one already achieved (e.g. a double three-year degree.) Benefits are awarded by calculating and combining elements such as the applicant’s income and merit. Specific categories of students may benefit from facilitations and exemptions, such as students with disabilities of no less than 66%. Support for filling in the application form DiSCo provides various operational and informative tools, making up a system of constantly updated rules and procedures that can be found on the Call for Applications’ webpage at www.laziodisco.it. The presence of explanatory/support resources in the call for applications is flagged through symbols. An example of this is the command “see video” identified by the following icon: “ ” which indicates the requirement to watch a video. The videos and other materials to understand and read the call for applications will be active also on the online application form. However, the text of the call for applications is the only complete and correct guide to submit applications.

{"pdf": "EU's data protection regulation.pdf.pdf", "question": "What key factor, according to Recital (5), has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data?", "expected_chunk_ids": ["e316771e-1b80-4550-89b5-b62961b2c7ae"], "expected_chunks": ["proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2), Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3), (1) The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. (2) The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural persons. (3) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow of personal data between Member States. 4.5.2016 L 119/1 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) OJ C 229, 31.7.2012, p. 90. (2) OJ C 391, 18.12.2012, p. 127. (3) Position of the European Parliament of 12 March 2014 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and position of the Council at first reading of 8 April 2016 (not yet published in the Official Journal). Position of the European Parliament of 14 April 2016. (4) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31). (4) The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity. (5) The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State. (6) Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data. (7) Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced. (8) Where this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law. (9) The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC. (10) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation. In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (‘sensitive data’). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. 4.5.2016 L 119/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN (11) Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States. (12) Article 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free movement of personal data. (13) In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (1). (14) The protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence, in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person. (15) In order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of natural persons should be technolo­ gically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation. (16) This Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union. (17) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) applies to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this Regulation and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should follow after the adoption of this Regulation, in order to allow application at the same time as this Regulation. (18) This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or 4.5.2016 L 119/3 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium‑sized enterprises (C(2003) 1422) (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36). (2) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1). household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities. (19) The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Member States may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation. With regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories. (20) While this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory authorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision- making. It should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations. (21) This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive. That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between Member States. (22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect. 4.5.2016 L 119/4 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (see page 89 of this Official Journal). (2) Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’) (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1). (23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union. (24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes. (25) Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post. (26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes. (27) This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons. (28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of ‘pseudony­ misation’ in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection. (29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymi­ sation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller. 4.5.2016 L 119/5 Official Journal of the European Union EN (30) Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them. (31) Public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent adminis­ trative authorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. (32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided. (33) It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose. (34) Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained. (35) Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) to that natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability, disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data subject independent of its source, for example from a physician or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic test. (36) The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be 4.5.2016 L 119/6 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross‑border healthcare (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45). the main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking. (37) A group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of undertakings. (38) Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child. (39) Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi­ cation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. (40) In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or 4.5.2016 L 119/7 Official Journal of the European Union"], "answer_snippet": "The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market"}

Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. (2) The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural persons. (3) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow of personal data between Member States. 4.5.2016 L 119/1 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) OJ C 229, 31.7.2012, p. 90. (2) OJ C 391, 18.12.2012, p. 127. (3) Position of the European Parliament of 12 March 2014 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and position of the Council at first reading of 8 April 2016 (not yet published in the Official Journal). Position of the European Parliament of 14 April 2016. (4) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31). (4) The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity. (5) The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State. (6) Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data. (7) Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced. (8) Where this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law. (9) The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC. (10) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation. In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (‘sensitive data’). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. 4.5.2016 L 119/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN (11) Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States. (12) Article 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free movement of personal data. (13) In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (1). (14) The protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence, in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person. (15) In order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of natural persons should be technolo­ gically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation. (16) This Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union. (17) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) applies to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this Regulation and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should follow after the adoption of this Regulation, in order to allow application at the same time as this Regulation. (18) This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or 4.5.2016 L 119/3 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium‑sized enterprises (C(2003) 1422) (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36). (2) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1). household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities. (19) The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Member States may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation. With regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories. (20) While this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory authorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision- making. It should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations. (21) This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive. That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between Member States. (22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect. 4.5.2016 L 119/4 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (see page 89 of this Official Journal). (2) Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’) (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1). (23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union. (24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes. (25) Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post. (26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes. (27) This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons. (28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of ‘pseudony­ misation’ in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection. (29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymi­ sation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller. 4.5.2016 L 119/5 Official Journal of the European Union EN (30) Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them. (31) Public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent adminis­ trative authorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. (32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided. (33) It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose. (34) Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained. (35) Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) to that natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability, disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data subject independent of its source, for example from a physician or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic test. (36) The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be 4.5.2016 L 119/6 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross‑border healthcare (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45). the main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking. (37) A group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of undertakings. (38) Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child. (39) Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi­ cation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. (40) In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or 4.5.2016 L 119/7 Official Journal of the European Union"], "answer_snippet": "Rapid technological developments and globalisation"}

More than 500,000 copies are in print, including translations in eight languages. I’ve received letters and emails from readers as young as 10, as well as from retirees who want to learn to program in their free time. Python Crash Course is being used in middle schools and high schools, and also in college classes. Students who are assigned more advanced textbooks are using Python Crash Course as a companion text for their classes and find- ing it a worthwhile supplement. People are using it to enhance their skills on the job and to start working on their own side projects. In short, people are using the book for the full range of purposes I had hoped they would. The opportunity to write a second edition of Python Crash Course has been thoroughly enjoyable. Although Python is a mature language, it continues to evolve as every language does. My goal in revising the book was to make it leaner and simpler. There is no longer any reason to learn Python 2, so this edition focuses on Python 3 only. Many Python packages have become easier to install, so setup and installation instructions are easier. I’ve added a few topics that I’ve realized readers would benefit from, and I’ve updated some sections to reflect new, simpler ways of doing things in Python. I’ve also clarified some sections where certain details of the xxviii Preface to the Second Edition language were not presented as accurately as they could have been. All the projects have been completely updated using popular, well-maintained libraries that you can confidently use to build your own projects. The following is a summary of specific changes that have been made in the second edition: • In Chapter 1, the instructions for installing Python have been simpli- fied for users of all major operating systems. I now recommend the text editor Sublime Text, which is popular among beginner and professional programmers and works well on all operating systems. • Chapter 2 includes a more accurate description of how variables are implemented in Python. Variables are described as labels for values, which leads to a better understanding of how variables behave in Python. The book now uses f-strings, introduced in Python 3.6. This is a much simpler way to use variable values in strings. The use of underscores to represent large numbers, such as 1_000_000, was also introduced in Python 3.6 and is included in this edition. Multiple assignment of variables was previously introduced in one of the projects, and that description has been generalized and moved to Chapter 2 for the benefit of all readers. Finally, a clear convention for representing constant values in Python is included in this chapter. • In Chapter 6, I introduce the get() method for retrieving values from a dictionary, which can return a default value if a key does not exist. • The Alien Invasion project (Chapters 12−14) is now entirely class- based. The game itself is a class, rather than a series of functions. This greatly simplifies the overall structure of the game, vastly reduc- ing the number of function calls and parameters required. Readers familiar with the first edition will appreciate the simplicity this new class-based approach provides. Pygame can now be installed in one line on all systems, and readers are given the option of running the game in fullscreen mode or in a windowed mode. • In the data visualization projects, the installation instructions for Matplotlib are simpler for all operating systems. The visualizations featuring Matplotlib use the subplots() function, which will be easier to build upon as you learn to create more complex visualizations. The Rolling Dice project in Chapter 15 uses Plotly, a well-maintained visualization library that features a clean syntax and beautiful, fully customizable output. • In Chapter 16, the weather project is based on data from NOAA, which should be more stable over the next few years than the site used in the first edition. The mapping project focuses on global earthquake activity; by the end of this project you’ll have a stunning visualization showing Earth’s tectonic plate boundaries through a focus on the locations of all earthquakes over a given time period. You’ll learn to plot any data set involving geographic points. • Chapter 17 uses Plotly to visualize Python-related activity in open source projects on GitHub. Preface to the Second Edition xxix • The Learning Log project (Chapters 18−20) is built using the latest version of Django and styled using the latest version of Bootstrap. The process of deploying the project to Heroku has been simplified using the django-heroku package, and uses environment variables rather than modifying the settings.py files. This is a simpler approach and is more consistent with how professional programmers deploy modern Django projects. • Appendix A has been fully updated to recommend current best prac- tices in installing Python. Appendix B includes detailed instructions for setting up Sublime Text and brief descriptions of most of the major text editors and IDEs in current use. Appendix C directs readers to newer, more popular online resources for getting help, and Appendix D con- tinues to offer a mini crash course in using Git for version control. • The index has been thoroughly updated to allow you to use Python Crash Course as a reference for all of your future Python projects. Thank you for reading Python Crash Course! If you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to get in touch. Ack now l e dg m e n t s This book would not have been possible without the wonderful and extremely professional staff at No Starch Press. Bill Pollock invited me to write an introductory book, and I deeply appreciate that original offer. Tyler Ortman helped shape my thinking in the early stages of drafting. Liz Chadwick’s and Leslie Shen’s initial feedback on each chapter was invaluable, and Anne Marie Walker helped to clarify many parts of the book. Riley Hoffman answered every question I had about the process of assembling a complete book and patiently turned my work into a beautiful finished product. I’d like to thank Kenneth Love, the technical reviewer for Python Crash Course. I met Kenneth at PyCon one year, and his enthusiasm for the lan- guage and the Python community has been a constant source of profes- sional inspiration ever since. Kenneth went beyond simple fact-checking and reviewed the book with the goal of helping beginning programmers develop a solid understanding of the Python language and programming in general. That said, any inaccuracies that remain are completely my own. I’d like to thank my father for introducing me to programming at a young age and for not being afraid that I’d break his equipment. I’d like to thank my wife, Erin, for supporting and encouraging me through the writing of this book, and I’d like to thank my son, Ever, whose curiosity inspires me every single day. In t rodu c t ion Every programmer has a story about how they learned to write their first program. I started programming as a child when my father was working for Digital Equipment Corporation, one of the pioneering companies of the modern computing era. I wrote my first program on a kit computer that my dad had assembled in our basement. The com- puter consisted of nothing more than a bare motherboard connected to a keyboard without a case, and its monitor was a bare cathode ray tube. My initial program was a simple number guessing game, which looked some- thing like this: I'm thinking of a number! Try to guess the number I'm thinking of: 25 Too low! Guess again: 50 Too high! Guess again: 42 That's it! Would you like to play again? (yes/no) no Thanks for playing! xxxiv Introduction I’ll always remember how satisfied I felt watching my family play a game that I created and that worked as I intended it to. That early experience had a lasting impact. There is real satisfaction in building something with a purpose, something that solves a problem. The software I write now meets a more significant need than my childhood efforts, but the sense of satisfaction I get from creating a program that works is still largely the same. Who Is This Book For? The goal of this book is to bring you up to speed with Python as quickly as possible so you can build programs that work—games, data visualizations, and web applications—while developing a foundation in programming that will serve you well for the rest of your life. Python Crash Course is writ- ten for people of any age who have never before programmed in Python or have never programmed at all. This book is for those who want to learn the basics of programming quickly so they can focus on interesting projects, and those who like to test their understanding of new concepts by solving meaningful problems. Python Crash Course is also perfect for middle school and high school teachers who want to offer their students a project-based introduction to programming. If you’re taking a college class and want a friendlier introduction to Python than the text you’ve been assigned, this book could make your class easier as well. What Can You Expect to Learn? The purpose of this book is to make you a good programmer in general and a good Python programmer in particular. You’ll learn efficiently and adopt good habits as I provide you with a solid foundation in general pro- gramming concepts. After working your way through Python Crash Course, you should be ready to move on to more advanced Python techniques, and your next programming language will be even easier to grasp. In the first part of this book, you’ll learn basic programming concepts you need to know to write Python programs. These concepts are the same as those you’d learn when starting out in almost any programming language. You’ll learn about different kinds of data and the ways you can store data in lists and dictionaries within your programs. You’ll learn to build collections of data and work through those collections in efficient ways. You’ll learn to use while loops and if statements to test for certain conditions so you can run specific sections of code while those conditions are true and run other sections when they’re not—a technique that greatly helps you automate processes. You’ll learn to accept input from users to make your programs inter­ active and to keep your programs running as long as the user is active. You’ll explore how to write functions to make parts of your program reus- able, so you only have to write blocks of code that perform certain actions once and then use that code as many times as you like. You’ll then extend Introduction xxxv this concept to more complicated behavior with classes, making fairly simple programs respond to a variety of situations. You’ll learn to write programs that handle common errors gracefully. After working through each of these basic concepts, you’ll write a few short programs that solve some well-defined problems. Finally, you’ll take your first step toward intermediate program- ming by learning how to write tests for your code so you can develop your programs further without worrying about introducing bugs. All the informa- tion in Part I will prepare you for taking on larger, more complex projects. In Part II, you’ll apply what you learned in Part I to three projects. You can do any or all of these projects in whichever order works best for you. In the first project (Chapters 12–14), you’ll create a Space Invaders–style shoot- ing game called Alien Invasion, which consists of levels of increasing diffi- culty. After you’ve completed this project, you should be well on your way to being able to develop your own 2D games. The second project (Chapters 15–17) introduces you to data visualiza- tion. Data scientists aim to make sense of the vast amount of information available to them through a variety of visualization techniques. You’ll work with data sets that you generate through code, data sets that you download from online sources, and data sets your programs download automatically. After you’ve completed this project, you’ll be able to write programs that sift through large data sets and make visual representations of that stored information. In the third project (Chapters 18–20), you’ll build a small web applica- tion called Learning Log. This project allows you to keep a journal of ideas and concepts you’ve learned about a specific topic. You’ll be able to keep separate logs for different topics and allow others to create an account and start their own journals. You’ll also learn how to deploy your project so any- one can access it online from anywhere. Online Resources You can find all the supplementary resources for the book online at https:// nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e/ or http://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/. These resources include: Setup instructions These instructions are identical to what’s in the book but include active links you can click for all the different pieces. If you’re having any setup issues, refer to this resource. Updates Python, like all languages, is constantly evolving. I maintain a thorough set of updates, so if anything isn’t working, check here to see whether instructions have changed. Solutions to exercises You should spend significant time on your own attempting the exercises in the “Try It Yourself” sections. But if you’re stuck and can’t make any progress, solutions to most of the exercises are online. Cheat sheets A full set of downloadable cheat sheets for a quick refer- ence to major concepts is also online. xxxvi Introduction Why Python? Every year I consider whether to continue using Python or whether to move on to a different language—perhaps one that’s newer to the programming world. But I continue to focus on Python for many reasons. Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. Python’s syntax will also help you write “clean” code. Your code will be easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages. People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web appli- cations, solve business problems, and develop internal tools at all kinds of interesting companies. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work. One of the most important reasons I continue to use Python is because of the Python community, which includes an incredibly diverse and welcom- ing group of people. Community is essential to programmers because pro- gramming isn’t a solitary pursuit. Most of us, even the most experienced programmers, need to ask advice from others who have already solved similar problems. Having a well-connected and supportive community is critical in helping you solve problems, and the Python community is fully supportive of people like you who are learning Python as your first pro- gramming language. Python is a great language to learn, so let’s get started! Part I B a sic s Part I of this book teaches you the basic concepts you’ll need to write Python programs. Many of these concepts are common to all programming languages, so they’ll be useful throughout your life as a programmer. In Chapter 1 you’ll install Python on your computer and run your first program, which prints the message Hello world! to the screen. In Chapter 2 you’ll learn to store information in variables and work with text and numerical values. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce lists. Lists can store as much information as you want in one variable, allowing you to work with that data efficiently. You’ll be able to work with hundreds, thousands, and even millions of values in just a few lines of code. In Chapter 5 you’ll use if statements to write code that responds one way if certain conditions are true, and responds in a different way if those conditions are not true. Chapter 6 shows you how to use Python’s dictionaries, which let you make connections between different pieces of information. Like lists, dic- tionaries can contain as much information as you need to store. In Chapter 7 you’ll learn how to accept input from users to make your programs interactive. You’ll also learn about while loops, which run blocks of code repeatedly as long as certain conditions remain true. In Chapter 8 you’ll write functions, which are named blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be run whenever you need them. 2 Part I Chapter 9 introduces classes, which allow you to model real-world objects, such as dogs, cats, people, cars, rockets, and much more, so your code can represent anything real or abstract. Chapter 10 shows you how to work with files and handle errors so your programs won’t crash unexpectedly. You’ll store data before your program closes, and read the data back in when the program runs again. You’ll learn about Python’s exceptions, which allow you to anticipate errors, and make your programs handle those errors gracefully. In Chapter 11 you’ll learn to write tests for your code to check that your programs work the way you intend them to. As a result, you’ll be able to expand your programs without worrying about introducing new bugs. Testing your code is one of the first skills that will help you transition from beginner to intermediate programmer. 1 G e t t ing S ta r t e d In this chapter, you’ll run your first Python program, hello_world.py. First, you’ll need to check whether a recent version of Python is installed on your computer; if it isn’t, you’ll install it. You’ll also install a text editor to work with your Python programs. Text editors recognize Python code and highlight sections as you write, making it easy to understand your code’s structure. Setting Up Your Programming Environment Python differs slightly on different operating systems, so you’ll need to keep a few considerations in mind. In the following sections, we’ll make sure Python is set up correctly on your system. 4 Chapter 1 Python Versions Every programming language evolves as new ideas and technologies emerge, and the developers of Python have continually made the lan- guage more versatile and powerful. As of this writing, the latest version is Python 3.7, but everything in this book should run on Python 3.6 or later. In this section, we’ll find out if Python is already installed on your system and whether you need to install a newer version. Appendix A contains a comprehensive guide to installing the latest version of Python on each major operating system as well. Some old Python projects still use Python 2, but you should use Python 3. If Python 2 is installed on your system, it’s probably there to sup- port some older programs that your system needs. We’ll leave this installa- tion as is, and make sure you have a more recent version to work with. Running Snippets of Python Code You can run Python’s interpreter in a terminal window, allowing you to try bits of Python code without having to save and run an entire program. Throughout this book, you’ll see code snippets that look like this:  >>> print(\"Hello Python interpreter!\") Hello Python interpreter! The >>> prompt indicates that you should be using the terminal win- dow, and the bold text is the code you should type in and then execute by pressing enter. Most of the examples in the book are small, self-contained programs that you’ll run from your text editor rather than the terminal, because you’ll write most of your code in the text editor. But sometimes basic concepts will be shown in a series of snippets run through a Python terminal session to demonstrate particular concepts more efficiently. When you see three angle brackets in a code listing , you’re looking at code and output from a terminal session. We’ll try coding in the interpreter on your system in a moment. We’ll also use a text editor to create a simple program called Hello World! that has become a staple of learning to program. There’s a long-held tradition in the programming world that printing a Hello world! message to the screen as your first program in a new language will bring you good luck. Such a simple program serves a very real purpose. If it runs correctly on your system, any Python program you write should work as well. About the Sublime Text Editor Sublime Text is a simple text editor that can be installed on all modern operating systems. Sublime Text lets you run almost all of your programs directly from the editor instead of through a terminal. Your code runs in a terminal session embedded in the Sublime Text window, which makes it easy to see the output. Getting Started 5 Sublime Text is a beginner-friendly editor, but many professional pro- grammers use it as well. If you become comfortable using it while learning Python, you can continue using it as you progress to larger and more com- plicated projects. Sublime Text has a very liberal licensing policy: you can use the editor free of charge as long as you want, but the developers request that you purchase a license if you like it and want to keep using it. Appendix B provides information on other text editors. If you’re curi- ous about the other options, you might want to skim that appendix at this point. If you want to begin programming quickly, you can use Sublime Text to start and consider other editors once you’ve gained some experience as a programmer. In this chapter, I’ll walk you through installing Sublime Text on your operating system. Python on Different Operating Systems Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means it runs on all the major operating systems. Any Python program you write should run on any modern computer that has Python installed. However, the methods for setting up Python on different operating systems vary slightly. In this section, you’ll learn how to set up Python on your system. You’ll first check whether a recent version of Python is installed on your system and install it if it’s not. Then you’ll install Sublime Text. These are the only two steps that are different for each operating system. In the sections that follow, you’ll run the Hello World! program and troubleshoot anything that didn’t work. I’ll walk you through this process for each operating system, so you’ll have a beginner-friendly Python pro- gramming environment. Python on Windows Windows doesn’t always come with Python, so you’ll probably need to install it, and then install Sublime Text. Installing Python First, check whether Python is installed on your system. Open a command window by entering command into the Start menu or by holding down the shift key while right-clicking on your desktop and selecting Open com- mand window here from the menu. In the terminal window, enter python in lowercase. If you get a Python prompt (>>>) in response, Python is installed on your system. If you see an error message telling you that python is not a recognized command, Python isn’t installed. In that case, or if you see a version of Python earlier than Python 3.6, you need to download a Python installer for Windows. Go to https://python .org/ and hover over the Downloads link. You should see a button for downloading the latest version of Python. Click the button, which should automatically start downloading the correct installer for your system. After 6 Chapter 1 you’ve downloaded the file, run the installer. Make sure you select the option Add Python to PATH, which will make it easier to configure your system correctly. Figure 1-1 shows this option selected. Figure 1-1: Make sure you select the checkbox labeled Add Python to PATH. Running Python in a Terminal Session Open a command window and enter python in lowercase. You should see a Python prompt (>>>), which means Windows has found the version of Python you just installed."], "answer_snippet": " It uses clear, step-by-step instructions, covers basic concepts comprehensively, and provides hands-on projects that reinforce learning"}
{"pdf": "Python Crash Course_ A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming.pdf.pdf", "question": "What key concept is taught by the \"detecting collisions\" section in the Alien Invasion chapter?\n", "expected_chunk_ids": ["e265d1ce-7a4d-49eb-89e8-0fabde947a30"], "expected_chunks": ["== pygame.KEYDOWN: if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT: self.ship.moving_right = True elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT: self.ship.moving_left = True elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP: if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT: self.ship.moving_right = False elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT: self.ship.moving_left = False If a KEYDOWN event occurs for the K_LEFT key, we set moving_left to True. If a event occurs for the K_LEFT key, we set moving_left to False. We can use elif blocks here because each event is connected to only one key. If the player presses both keys at once, two separate events will be detected. When you run alien_invasion.py now, you should be able to move the ship continuously to the right and left. If you hold down both keys, the ship should stop moving. Next, we’ll further refine the ship’s movement. Let’s adjust the ship’s speed and limit how far the ship can move so it can’t disappear off the sides of the screen. Adjusting the Ship’s Speed Currently, the ship moves one pixel per cycle through the while loop, but we can take finer control of the ship’s speed by adding a ship_speed attribute to the Settings class. We’ll use this attribute to determine how far to move the ship on each pass through the loop. Here’s the new attribute in settings.py: class Settings: \"\"\"A class to store all settings for Alien Invasion.\"\"\" def __init__(self): --snip-- # Ship settings self.ship_speed = 1.5 alien_invasion.py settings.py 242 Chapter 12 We set the initial value of ship_speed to 1.5. When the ship moves now, its position is adjusted by 1.5 pixels rather than 1 pixel on each pass through the loop. We’re using decimal values for the speed setting to give us finer con- trol of the ship’s speed when we increase the tempo of the game later on. However, rect attributes such as x store only integer values, so we need to make some modifications to Ship: class Ship: \"\"\"A class to manage the ship.\"\"\" u def __init__(self, ai_game): \"\"\"Initialize the ship and set its starting position.\"\"\" self.screen = ai_game.screen self.settings = ai_game.settings --snip-- # Start each new ship at the bottom center of the screen. --snip-- # Store a decimal value for the ship's horizontal position. v self.x = float(self.rect.x) # Movement flags self.moving_right = False self.moving_left = False def update(self): \"\"\"Update the ship's position based on movement flags.\"\"\" # Update the ship's x value, not the rect. if self.moving_right: w self.x += self.settings.ship_speed if self.moving_left: self.x -= self.settings.ship_speed # Update rect object from self.x. x self.rect.x = self.x def blitme(self): --snip-- We create a settings attribute for Ship, so we can use it in update() u. Because we’re adjusting the position of the ship by fractions of a pixel, we need to assign the position to a variable that can store a decimal value. You can use a decimal value to set an attribute of rect, but the rect will only keep the integer portion of that value. To keep track of the ship’s position accurately, we define a new self.x attribute that can hold decimal values v. We use the float() function to convert the value of self.rect.x to a decimal and assign this value to self.x. Now when we change the ship’s position in update(), the value of self.x is adjusted by the amount stored in settings.ship_speed w. After self.x has been updated, we use the new value to update self.rect.x, which controls ship.py A Ship that Fires Bullets 243 the position of the ship x. Only the integer portion of self.x will be stored in self.rect.x, but that’s fine for displaying the ship. Now we can change the value of ship_speed, and any value greater than one will make the ship move faster. This will help make the ship respond quickly enough to shoot down aliens, and it will let us change the tempo of the game as the player progresses in gameplay. N o t e If you’re using macOS, you might notice that the ship moves very slowly, even with a high speed setting. You can remedy this problem by running the game in fullscreen mode, which we’ll implement shortly. Limiting the Ship’s Range At this point, the ship will disappear off either edge of the screen if you hold down an arrow key long enough. Let’s correct this so the ship stops moving when it reaches the screen’s edge. We do this by modifying the update() method in Ship: def update(self): \"\"\"Update the ship's position based on movement flags.\"\"\" # Update the ship's x value, not the rect. u if self.moving_right and self.rect.right < self.screen_rect.right: self.x += self.settings.ship_speed v if self.moving_left and self.rect.left > 0: self.x -= self.settings.ship_speed # Update rect object from self.x. self.rect.x = self.x This code checks the position of the ship before changing the value of self.x. The code self.rect.right returns the x-coordinate of the right edge of the ship’s rect. If this value is less than the value returned by self.screen _rect.right, the ship hasn’t reached the right edge of the screen u. The same goes for the left edge: if the value of the left side of the rect is greater than zero, the ship hasn’t reached the left edge of the screen v. This ensures the ship is within these bounds before adjusting the value of self.x. When you run alien_invasion.py now, the ship should stop moving at either edge of the screen. This is pretty cool; all we’ve done is add a condi­ tional test in an if statement, but it feels like the ship hits a wall or a force field at either edge of the screen! Refactoring _check_events() The _check_events() method will increase in length as we continue to develop the game, so let’s break _check_events() into two more methods: one that handles KEYDOWN events and another that handles KEYUP events: def _check_events(self): \"\"\"Respond to keypresses and mouse events.\"\"\" for event in pygame.event.get(): ship.py alien_invasion.py 244 Chapter 12 if event.type == pygame.QUIT: sys.exit() elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: self._check_keydown_events(event) elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP: self._check_keyup_events(event) def _check_keydown_events(self, event): \"\"\"Respond to keypresses.\"\"\" if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT: self.ship.moving_right = True elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT: self.ship.moving_left = True def _check_keyup_events(self, event): \"\"\"Respond to key releases.\"\"\" if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT: self.ship.moving_right = False elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT: self.ship.moving_left = False We make two new helper methods: _check_keydown_events() and _check _keyup_events(). Each needs a self parameter and an event parameter. The bodies of these two methods are copied from _check_events(), and we’ve replaced the old code with calls to the new methods. The _check_events() method is simpler now with this cleaner code structure, which will make it easier to develop further responses to player input. Pressing Q to Quit Now that we’re responding to keypresses efficiently, we can add another way to quit the game. It gets tedious to click the X at the top of the game window to end the game every time you test a new feature, so we’ll add a keyboard shortcut to end the game when the player presses Q: def _check_keydown_events(self, event): --snip-- elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT: self.ship.moving_left = True elif event.key == pygame.K_q: sys.exit() In _check_keydown_events(), we add a new block that ends the game when the player presses Q. Now, when testing, you can press Q to close the game rather than using your cursor to close the window. Running the Game in Fullscreen Mode Pygame has a fullscreen mode that you might like better than running the game in a regular window. Some games look better in fullscreen mode, and macOS users might see better performance in fullscreen mode. alien_invasion.py A Ship that Fires Bullets 245 To run the game in fullscreen mode, make the following changes in __init__(): def __init__(self): \"\"\"Initialize the game, and create game resources.\"\"\" pygame.init() self.settings = Settings() u self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((0, 0), pygame.FULLSCREEN) v self.settings.screen_width = self.screen.get_rect().width self.settings.screen_height = self.screen.get_rect().height pygame.display.set_caption(\"Alien Invasion\") When creating the screen surface, we pass a size of (0, 0) and the parameter pygame.FULLSCREEN u. This tells Pygame to figure out a window size that will fill the screen. Because we don’t know the width and height of the screen ahead of time, we update these settings after the screen is created v. We use the width and height attributes of the screen’s rect to update the ­settings object. If you like how the game looks or behaves in fullscreen mode, keep these settings. If you liked the game better in its own window, you can revert back to the original approach where we set a specific screen size for the game. N o t e Make sure you can quit by pressing Q before running the game in fullscreen mode; Pygame offers no default way to quit a game while in fullscreen mode. A Quick Recap In the next section, we’ll add the ability to shoot bullets, which involves add­ ing a new file called bullet.py and making some modifications to some of the files we’re already using. Right now, we have three files containing a num­ ber of classes and methods. To be clear about how the project is organized, let’s review each of these files before adding more functionality. alien_invasion.py The main file, alien_invasion.py, contains the AlienInvasion class. This class creates a number of important attributes used throughout the game: the settings are assigned to settings, the main display surface is assigned to screen, and a ship instance is created in this file as well. The main loop of the game, a while loop, is also stored in this module. The while loop calls _check_events(), ship.update(), and _update_screen(). The _check_events() method detects relevant events, such as key­ presses and releases, and processes each of these types of events through the methods _check_keydown_events() and _check_keyup_events(). For now, alien_invasion.py 246 Chapter 12 these methods manage the ship’s movement. The AlienInvasion class also contains _update_screen(), which redraws the screen on each pass through the main loop. The alien_invasion.py file is the only file you need to run when you want to play Alien Invasion. The other files—settings.py and ship.py—contain code that is imported into this file. settings.py The settings.py file contains the Settings class. This class only has an __init__() method, which initializes attributes controlling the game’s appearance and the ship’s speed. ship.py The ship.py file contains the Ship class. The Ship class has an __init__() method, an update() method to manage the ship’s position, and a blitme() method to draw the ship to the screen. The image of the ship is stored in ship.bmp, which is in the images folder. Try It Yourself 12-3. Pygame Documentation: We’re far enough into the game now that you might want to look at some of the Pygame documentation. The Pygame home page is at https://www.pygame.org/, and the home page for the documenta- tion is at https://www.pygame.org/docs/. Just skim the documentation for now. You won’t need it to complete this project, but it will help if you want to modify Alien Invasion or make your own game afterward. 12-4. Rocket: Make a game that begins with a rocket in the center of the screen. Allow the player to move the rocket up, down, left, or right using the four arrow keys. Make sure the rocket never moves beyond any edge of the screen. 12-5. Keys: Make a Pygame file that creates an empty screen. In the event loop, print the event.key attribute whenever a pygame.KEYDOWN event is detected. Run the program and press various keys to see how Pygame responds. Shooting Bullets Now let’s add the ability to shoot bullets. We’ll write code that fires a bullet, which is represented by a small rectangle, when the player presses the space­ bar. Bullets will then travel straight up the screen until they disappear off the top of the screen. A Ship that Fires Bullets 247 Adding the Bullet Settings At the end of the __init__() method, we’ll update settings.py to include the values we’ll need for a new Bullet class: def __init__(self): --snip-- # Bullet settings self.bullet_speed = 1.0 self.bullet_width = 3 self.bullet_height = 15 self.bullet_color = (60, 60, 60) These settings create dark gray bullets with a width of 3 pixels and a height of 15 pixels. The bullets will travel slightly slower than the ship. Creating the Bullet Class Now create a bullet.py file to store our Bullet class. Here’s the first part of ­bullet.py: import pygame from pygame.sprite import Sprite class Bullet(Sprite): \"\"\"A class to manage bullets fired from the ship\"\"\" def __init__(self, ai_game): \"\"\"Create a bullet object at the ship's current position.\"\"\" super().__init__() self.screen = ai_game.screen self.settings = ai_game.settings self.color = self.settings.bullet_color # Create a bullet rect at (0, 0) and then set correct position. u self.rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.settings.bullet_width, self.settings.bullet_height) v self.rect.midtop = ai_game.ship.rect.midtop # Store the bullet's position as a decimal value. w self.y = float(self.rect.y) The Bullet class inherits from Sprite, which we import from the pygame .sprite module. When you use sprites, you can group related elements in your game and act on all the grouped elements at once. To create a bullet instance, __init__() needs the current instance of AlienInvasion, and we call super() to inherit properly from Sprite. We also set attributes for the screen and settings objects, and for the bullet’s color. At u, we create the bullet’s rect attribute. The bullet isn’t based on an image, so we have to build a rect from scratch using the pygame.Rect() class. This class requires the x- and y-coordinates of the top-left corner of the settings.py bullet.py 248 Chapter 12 rect, and the width and height of the rect. We initialize the rect at (0, 0), but we’ll move it to the correct location in the next line, because the bullet’s position depends on the ship’s position. We get the width and height of the bullet from the values stored in self.settings. At v, we set the bullet’s midtop attribute to match the ship’s midtop attri­ bute. This will make the bullet emerge from the top of the ship, making it look like the bullet is fired from the ship. We store a decimal value for the bullet’s y-coordinate so we can make fine adjustments to the bullet’s speed w. Here’s the second part of bullet.py, update() and draw_bullet(): def update(self): \"\"\"Move the bullet up the screen.\"\"\" # Update the decimal position of the bullet. u self.y -= self.settings.bullet_speed # Update the rect position. v self.rect.y = self.y def draw_bullet(self): \"\"\"Draw the bullet to the screen.\"\"\" w pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, self.color, self.rect) The update() method manages the bullet’s position. When a bullet is fired, it moves up the screen, which corresponds to a decreasing y-coordinate value. To update the position, we subtract the amount stored in settings .bullet_speed from self.y u. We then use the value of self.y to set the value of self.rect.y v. The bullet_speed setting allows us to increase the speed of the bullets as the game progresses or as needed to refine the game’s behavior. Once a bullet is fired, we never change the value of its x-coordinate, so it will travel vertically in a straight line even if the ship moves. When we want to draw a bullet, we call draw_bullet(). The draw.rect() function fills the part of the screen defined by the bullet’s rect with the color stored in self.color w. Storing Bullets in a Group Now that we have a Bullet class and the necessary settings defined, we can write code to fire a bullet each time the player presses the spacebar. We’ll create a group in AlienInvasion to store all the live bullets so we can man­ age the bullets that have already been fired. This group will be an instance of the pygame.sprite.Group class, which behaves like a list with some extra functionality that’s helpful when building games. We’ll use this group to draw bullets to the screen on each pass through the main loop and to update each bullet’s position. We’ll create the group in __init__(): def __init__(self): --snip-- self.ship = Ship(self) self.bullets = pygame.sprite.Group() bullet.py alien_invasion.py A Ship that Fires Bullets 249 Then we need to update the position of the bullets on each pass through the while loop: def run_game(self): \"\"\"Start the main loop for the game.\"\"\" while True: self._check_events() self.ship.update() u self.bullets.update() self._update_screen() When you call update() on a group u, the group automatically calls update() for each sprite in the group. The line self.bullets.update() calls ­bullet.update() for each bullet we place in the group bullets. Firing Bullets In AlienInvasion, we need to modify _check_keydown_events() to fire a bullet when the player presses the spacebar. We don’t need to change _check_keyup _events() because nothing happens when the spacebar is released. We also need to modify _update_screen() to make sure each bullet is drawn to the screen before we call flip(). We know there will be a bit of work to do when we fire a bullet, so let’s write a new method, _fire_bullet(), to handle this work: --snip-- from ship import Ship u from bullet import Bullet class AlienInvasion: --snip-- def _check_keydown_events(self, event): --snip-- elif event.key == pygame.K_q: sys.exit() v elif event.key == pygame.K_SPACE: self._fire_bullet() def _check_keyup_events(self, event): --snip-- def _fire_bullet(self): \"\"\"Create a new bullet and add it to the bullets group.\"\"\" w new_bullet = Bullet(self) x self.bullets.add(new_bullet) def _update_screen(self): \"\"\"Update images on the screen, and flip to the new screen.\"\"\" self.screen.fill(self.settings.bg_color) self.ship.blitme() y for bullet in self.bullets.sprites(): bullet.draw_bullet() alien_invasion.py alien_invasion.py 250 Chapter 12 pygame.display.flip() --snip-- First, we import Bullet u. Then we call _fire_bullet() when the space­ bar is pressed v. In _fire_bullet(), we make an instance of Bullet and call it new_bullet w. We then add it to the group bullets using the add() method x. The add() method is similar to append(), but it’s a method that’s written spe­ cifically for Pygame groups. The bullets.sprites() method returns a list of all sprites in the group bullets. To draw all fired bullets to the screen, we loop through the sprites in bullets and call draw_bullet() on each one y. When you run alien_invasion.py now, you should be able to move the ship right and left, and fire as many bullets as you want. The bullets travel up the screen and disappear when they reach the top, as shown in Figure 12-3. You can alter the size, color, and speed of the bullets in settings.py. Figure 12-3: The ship after firing a series of bullets Deleting Old Bullets At the moment, the bullets disappear when they reach the top, but only because Pygame can’t draw them above the top of the screen. The bullets actually continue to exist; their y-coordinate values just grow increasingly negative. This is a problem, because they continue to consume memory and processing power. A Ship that Fires Bullets 251 We need to get rid of these old bullets, or the game will slow down from doing so much unnecessary work. To do this, we need to detect when the bottom value of a bullet’s rect has a value of 0, which indicates the bullet has passed off the top of the screen: def run_game(self): \"\"\"Start the main loop for the game.\"\"\" while True: self._check_events() self.ship.update() self.bullets.update() # Get rid of bullets that have disappeared. u for bullet in self.bullets.copy(): v if bullet.rect.bottom <= 0: w self.bullets.remove(bullet) x print(len(self.bullets)) self._update_screen() When you use a for loop with a list (or a group in Pygame), Python expects that the list will stay the same length as long as the loop is run­ ning. Because we can’t remove items from a list or group within a for loop, we have to loop over a copy of the group. We use the copy() method to set up the for loop u, which enables us to modify bullets inside the loop. We check each bullet to see whether it has disappeared off the top of the screen at v. If it has, we remove it from bullets w. At x we insert a print() call to show how many bullets currently exist in the game and verify that they’re being deleted when they reach the top of the screen. If this code works correctly, we can watch the terminal output while fir­ ing bullets and see that the number of bullets decreases to zero after each series of bullets has cleared the top of the screen. After you run the game and verify that bullets are being deleted properly, remove the print() call. If you leave it in, the game will slow down significantly because it takes more time to write output to the terminal than it does to draw graphics to the game window. Limiting the Number of Bullets Many shooting games limit the number of bullets a player can have on the screen at one time; doing so encourages players to shoot accurately. We’ll do the same in Alien Invasion. First, store the number of bullets allowed in settings.py: # Bullet settings --snip-- self.bullet_color = (60, 60, 60) self.bullets_allowed = 3 alien_invasion.py settings.py 252 Chapter 12 This limits the player to three bullets at a time. We’ll use this setting in AlienInvasion to check how many bullets exist before creating a new bullet in _fire_bullet(): def _fire_bullet(self): \"\"\"Create a new bullet and add it to the bullets group.\"\"\" if len(self.bullets) < self.settings.bullets_allowed: new_bullet = Bullet(self) self.bullets.add(new_bullet) When the player presses the spacebar, we check the length of bullets. If len(self.bullets) is less than three, we create a new bullet. But if three bullets are already active, nothing happens when the spacebar is pressed. When you run the game now, you should be able to fire bullets only in groups of three. Creating the _update_bullets() Method We want to keep the AlienInvasion class reasonably well organized, so now that we’ve written and checked the bullet management code, we can move it to a separate method. We’ll create a new method called _update_bullets() and add it just before _update_screen(): def _update_bullets(self): \"\"\"Update position of bullets and get rid of old bullets.\"\"\" # Update bullet positions. self.bullets.update() # Get rid of bullets that have disappeared. for bullet in self.bullets.copy(): if bullet.rect.bottom <= 0: self.bullets.remove(bullet) The code for _update_bullets() is cut and pasted from run_game(); all we’ve done here is clarify the comments. The while loop in run_game() looks simple again: while True: self._check_events() self.ship.update() self._update_bullets() self._update_screen() Now our main loop contains only minimal code, so we can quickly read the method names and understand what’s happening in the game. The main loop checks for player input, and then updates the position of the ship and any bullets that have been fired. We then use the updated posi- tions to draw a new screen. Run alien_invasion.py one more time, and make sure you can still fire bullets without errors. alien_invasion.py alien_invasion.py alien_invasion.py A Ship that Fires Bullets 253 Try It Yourself 12-6. Sideways Shooter: Write a game that places a ship on the left side of the screen and allows the player to move the ship up and down. Make the ship fire a bullet that travels right across the screen when the player presses the space- bar. Make sure bullets are deleted once they disappear off the screen. Summary In this chapter, you learned to make a plan for a game and learned the basic structure of a game written in Pygame. You learned to set a background color and store settings in a separate class where you can adjust them more easily. You saw how to draw an image to the screen and give the player control over the movement of game elements. You created elements that move on their own, like bullets flying up a screen, and deleted objects that are no longer needed. You also learned to refactor code in a project on a regular basis to facilitate ongoing development. In Chapter 13, we’ll add aliens to Alien Invasion. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to shoot down aliens, hopefully before they reach your ship! 13 A l ie n s! In this chapter, we’ll add aliens to Alien Invasion. We’ll add one alien near the top of the screen and then generate a whole fleet of aliens. We’ll make the fleet advance ­sideways and down, and we’ll get rid of any aliens hit by a bullet. Finally, we’ll limit the number of ships a player has and end the game when the player runs out of ships. As you work through this chapter, you’ll learn more about Pygame and about managing a large project. You’ll also learn to detect collisions between game objects, like bullets and aliens. Detecting collisions helps you define interactions between elements in your games: for example, you can 256 Chapter 13 confine a character inside the walls of a maze or pass a ball between two characters. We’ll continue to work from a plan that we revisit occasionally to maintain the focus of our code-writing sessions. Before we start writing new code to add a fleet of aliens to the screen, let’s look at the project and update our plan. Reviewing the Project When you’re beginning a new phase of development on a large project, it’s always a good idea to revisit your plan and clarify what you want to accom- plish with the code you’re about to write. In this chapter, we’ll: • Examine our code and determine if we need to refactor before imple- menting new features. • Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen with appropriate spacing around it. • Use the spacing around the first alien and the overall screen size to determine how many aliens can fit on the screen. We’ll write a loop to create aliens to fill the upper portion of the screen. • Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the entire fleet is shot down, we’ll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the ship or the ground, we’ll destroy the ship and create a new fleet. • Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when the player has used up the allotted number of ships. We’ll refine this plan as we implement features, but this is sufficient to start with. You should also review your existing code when you begin working on a new series of features in a project. Because each new phase typically makes a project more complex, it’s best to clean up any cluttered or ineffi- cient code. We’ve been refactoring as we go, so there isn’t any code that we need to refactor at this point. Creating the First Alien Placing one alien on the screen is like placing a ship on the screen. Each alien’s behavior is controlled by a class called Alien, which we’ll structure like the Ship class. We’ll continue using bitmap images for simplicity. You can find your own image for an alien or use the one shown in Figure 13-1, which is available in the book’s resources at https://nostarch.com/­pythoncrashcourse2e/. This image has a gray background, which matches the screen’s background color. Make sure you save the image file you choose in the images folder. Aliens! 257 Figure 13-1: The alien we’ll use to build the fleet Creating the Alien Class Now we’ll write the Alien class and save it as alien.py: import pygame from pygame.sprite import Sprite class Alien(Sprite): \"\"\"A class to represent a single alien in the fleet.\"\"\" def __init__(self, ai_game): \"\"\"Initialize the alien and set its starting position.\"\"\" super().__init__() self.screen = ai_game.screen # Load the alien image and set its rect attribute. self.image = pygame.image.load('images/alien.bmp') self.rect = self.image.get_rect() # Start each new alien near the top left of the screen. u self.rect.x = self.rect.width self.rect.y = self.rect.height # Store the alien's exact horizontal position. v self.x = float(self.rect.x) Most of this class is like the Ship class except for the aliens’ placement on the screen. We initially place each alien near the top-left corner of the screen; we add a space to the left of it that’s equal to the alien’s width and a space above it equal to its height u so it’s easy to see. We’re mainly alien.py 258 Chapter 13 concerned with the aliens’ horizontal speed, so we’ll track the horizontal position of each alien precisely v. This Alien class doesn’t need a method for drawing it to the screen; instead, we’ll use a Pygame group method that automatically draws all the elements of a group to the screen. Creating an Instance of the Alien We want to create an instance of Alien so we can see the first alien on the screen. Because it’s part of our setup work, we’ll add the code for this instance at the end of the __init__() method in AlienInvasion. Eventually, we’ll create an entire fleet of aliens, which will be quite a bit of work, so we’ll make a new helper method called _create_fleet(). The order of methods in a class doesn’t matter, as long as there’s some consistency to how they’re placed. I’ll place _create_fleet() just before the _update_screen() method, but anywhere in AlienInvasion will work. First, we’ll import the Alien class. Here are the updated import statements for alien_invasion.py: --snip-- from bullet import Bullet from alien import Alien And here’s the updated __init__() method: def __init__(self): --snip-- self.ship = Ship(self) self.bullets = pygame.sprite.Group() self.aliens = pygame.sprite.Group() self._create_fleet() We create a group to hold the fleet of aliens, and we call _create_fleet(), which we’re about to write. Here’s the new _create_fleet() method: def _create_fleet(self): \"\"\"Create the fleet of aliens.\"\"\" # Make an alien. alien = Alien(self) self.aliens.add(alien) In this method, we’re creating one instance of Alien, and then adding it to the group that will hold the fleet. The alien will be placed in the default upper-left area of the screen, which is perfect for the first alien. alien_invasion.py alien_invasion.py alien_invasion.py Aliens! 259 To make the alien appear, we need to call the group’s draw() method in _update_screen(): def _update_screen(self): --snip-- for bullet in self.bullets.sprites(): bullet.draw_bullet() self.aliens.draw(self.screen) pygame.display.flip() When you call draw() on a group, Pygame draws each element in the group at the position defined by its rect attribute. The draw() method requires one argument: a surface on which to draw the elements from the group. Figure 13-2 shows the first alien on the screen. Figure 13-2: The first alien appears. Now that the first alien appears correctly, we’ll write the code to draw an entire fleet. Building the Alien Fleet To draw a fleet, we need to figure out how many aliens can fit across the screen and how many rows of aliens can fit down the screen. We’ll first fig- ure out the horizontal spacing between aliens and create a row; then we’ll determine the vertical spacing and create an entire fleet. alien_invasion.py 260 Chapter 13 Determining How Many Aliens Fit in a Row To figure out how many aliens fit in a row, let’s look at how much horizontal space we have. The screen width is stored in settings.screen_width, but we need an empty margin on either side of the screen. We’ll make this margin the width of one alien. Because we have two margins, the available space for aliens is the screen width minus two alien widths: available_space_x = settings.screen_width – (2 * alien_width) We also need to set the spacing between aliens; we’ll make it one alien width. The space needed to display one alien is twice its width: one width for the alien and one width for the empty space to its right. To find the number of aliens that fit across the screen, we divide the available space by two times the width of an alien. We use floor division (//), which divides two numbers and drops any remainder, so we’ll get an integer number of aliens: number_aliens_x = available_space_x // (2 * alien_width) We’ll use these calculations when we create the fleet. N o t e One great aspect of calculations in programming is that you don’t have to be sure your formulas are correct when you first write them. You can try them out and see if they work. At worst, you’ll have a screen that’s overcrowded with aliens or has too few aliens. You can then revise your calculations based on what you see on the screen. Creating a Row of Aliens We’re ready to generate a full row of aliens. Because our code for making a single alien works, we’ll rewrite _create_fleet() to make a whole row of aliens: def _create_fleet(self): \"\"\"Create the fleet of aliens.\"\"\" # Create an alien and find the number of aliens in a row. # Spacing between each alien is equal to one alien width. u alien = Alien(self) v alien_width = alien.rect.width w available_space_x = self.settings.screen_width - (2 * alien_width) number_aliens_x = available_space_x // (2 * alien_width) # Create the first row of aliens. x for alien_number in range(number_aliens_x): # Create an alien and place it in the row. alien = Alien(self) y alien.x = alien_width + 2 * alien_width * alien_number alien.rect.x = alien.x self.aliens.add(alien) alien_invasion.py Aliens! 261 We’ve already thought through most of this code. We need to know the alien’s width and height to place aliens, so we create an alien at u before we perform calculations. This alien won’t be part of the fleet, so don’t add it to the group aliens. At v we get the alien’s width from its rect attribute and store this value in alien_width so we don’t have to keep working through the rect attribute. At w we calculate the horizontal space available for aliens and the number of aliens that can fit into that space. Next, we set up a loop that counts from 0 to the number of aliens we need to make x. In the main body of the loop, we create a new alien and then set its x-coordinate value to place it in the row y. Each alien is pushed to the right one alien width from the left margin. Next, we multiply the alien width by 2 to account for the space each alien takes up, including the empty space to its right, and we multiply this amount by the alien’s position in the row. We use the alien’s x attribute to set the position of its rect. Then we add each new alien to the group aliens. When you run Alien Invasion now, you should see the first row of aliens appear, as in Figure 13-3. Figure 13-3: The first row of aliens The first row is offset to the left, which is actually good for gameplay. The reason is that we want the fleet to move right until it hits the edge of the screen, then drop down a bit, then move left, and so forth. Like the classic game Space Invaders, this movement is more interesting than having the fleet drop straight down. We’ll continue this motion until all aliens are shot down or until an alien hits the ship or the bottom of the screen. 262 Chapter 13 N o t e Depending on the screen width you’ve chosen, the alignment of the first row of aliens might look slightly different on your system. Refactoring _create_fleet() If the code we’ve written so far was all we need to create a fleet, we’d prob- ably leave _create_fleet() as is. But we have more work to do, so let’s clean up the method a bit. We’ll add a new helper method, _create_alien(), and call it from _create_fleet(): def _create_fleet(self): --snip-- # Create the first row of aliens. for alien_number in range(number_aliens_x): self._create_alien(alien_number) def _create_alien(self, alien_number): \"\"\"Create an alien and place it in the row.\"\"\" alien = Alien(self) alien_width = alien.rect.width alien.x = alien_width + 2 * alien_width * alien_number alien.rect.x = alien.x self.aliens.add(alien) The method _create_alien() requires one parameter in addition to self: it needs the alien number that’s currently being created. We use the same body we made for _create_fleet() except that we get the width of an alien inside the method instead of passing it as an argument. This refactoring will make it easier to add new rows and create an entire fleet. Adding Rows To finish the fleet, we’ll determine the number of rows that fit on the screen and then repeat the loop for creating the aliens in one row until we have the correct number of rows. To determine the number of rows, we find the available vertical space by subtracting the alien height from the top, the ship height from the bottom, and two alien heights from the bottom of the screen: available_space_y = settings.screen_height – (3 * alien_height) – ship_height The result will create some empty space above the ship, so the player has some time to start shooting aliens at the beginning of each level. Each row needs some empty space below it, which we’ll make equal to the height of one alien. To find the number of rows, we divide the available space by two times the height of an alien. We use floor division because we can only make an integer number of rows. (Again, if these calculations are off, we’ll see it right away and adjust our approach until we have reasonable spacing.) number_rows = available_height_y // (2 * alien_height) alien_invasion.py Aliens! 263 Now that we know how many rows fit in a fleet, we can repeat the code for creating a row: def _create_fleet(self): --snip-- alien = Alien(self) u alien_width, alien_height = alien.rect.size available_space_x = self.settings.screen_width - (2 * alien_width) number_aliens_x = available_space_x // (2 * alien_width) # Determine the number of rows of aliens that fit on the screen. ship_height = self.ship.rect.height v available_space_y = (self.settings.screen_height - (3 * alien_height) - ship_height) number_rows = available_space_y // (2 * alien_height) # Create the full fleet of aliens. w for row_number in range(number_rows): for alien_number in range(number_aliens_x): self._create_alien(alien_number, row_number) def _create_alien(self, alien_number, row_number): \"\"\"Create an alien and place it in the row.\"\"\" alien = Alien(self) alien_width, alien_height = alien.rect.size alien.x = alien_width + 2 * alien_width * alien_number alien.rect.x = alien.x x alien.rect.y = alien.rect.height + 2 * alien.rect.height * row_number self.aliens.add(alien) We need the width and height of an alien, so at u we use the attribute size, which contains a tuple with the width and height of a rect object. To calculate the number of rows we can fit on the screen, we write our available _space_y calculation right after the calculation for available_space_x v. The calculation is wrapped in parentheses so the outcome can be split over two lines, which results in lines of 79 characters or less, as is recommended. To create multiple rows, we use two nested loops: one outer and one inner loop w. The inner loop creates the aliens in one row. The outer loop counts from 0 to the number of rows we want; Python uses the code for making a single row and repeats it number_rows times. To nest the loops, write the new for loop and indent the code you want to repeat. (Most text editors make it easy to indent and unindent blocks of code, but for help see Appendix B.) Now when we call _create_alien(), we include an argument for the row number so each row can be placed farther down the screen. The definition of _create_alien() needs a parameter to hold the row number. Within _create_alien(), we change an alien’s y-coordinate value when it’s not in the first row x by starting with one alien’s height to ­create empty space at the top of the screen. Each row starts two alien heights below alien_invasion.py 264 Chapter 13 the previous row, so we multiply the alien height by two and then by the row number. The first row number is 0, so the vertical placement of the first row is unchanged. All subsequent rows are placed farther down the screen. When you run the game now, you should see a full fleet of aliens, as shown in Figure 13-4. Figure 13-4: The full fleet appears. In the next section, we’ll make the fleet move! Try It Yourself 13-1. Stars: Find an image of a star. Make a grid of stars appear on the screen. 13-2. Better Stars: You can make a more realistic star pattern by introducing randomness when you place each star. Recall that you can get a random num- ber like this: from random import randint random_number = randint(-10, 10) This code returns a random integer between −10 and 10. Using your code in Exercise 13-1, adjust each star’s position by a random amount. Aliens! 265 Making the Fleet Move Now let’s make the fleet of aliens move to the right across the screen until it hits the edge, and then make it drop a set amount and move in the other direction. We’ll continue this movement until all aliens have been shot down, one collides with the ship, or one reaches the bottom of the screen. Let’s begin by making the fleet move to the right. Moving the Aliens Right To move the aliens, we’ll use an update() method in alien.py, which we’ll call for each alien in the group of aliens. First, add a setting to control the speed of each alien: def __init__(self): --snip-- # Alien settings self.alien_speed = 1.0 Then use this setting to implement update(): def __init__(self, ai_game): \"\"\"Initialize the alien and set its starting position.\"\"\" super().__init__() self.screen = ai_game.screen self.settings = ai_game.settings --snip-- def update(self): \"\"\"Move the alien to the right.\"\"\" u self.x += self.settings.alien_speed v self.rect.x = self.x We create a settings parameter in __init__() so we can access the alien’s speed in update(). Each time we update an alien’s position, we move it to the right by the amount stored in alien_speed. We track the alien’s exact position with the self.x attribute, which can hold decimal values u. We then use the value of self.x to update the position of the alien’s rect v. In the main while loop, we already have calls to update the ship and bullet positions. Now we’ll add a call to update the position of each alien as well: while True: self._check_events() self.ship.update() self._update_bullets() self._update_aliens() self._update_screen() settings.py alien.py alien_invasion.py 266 Chapter 13 We’re about to write some code to manage the movement of the fleet, so we create a new method called _update_aliens(). We set the aliens’ posi- tions to update after the bullets have been updated, because we’ll soon be checking to see whether any bullets hit any aliens. Where you place this method in the module is not critical. But to keep the code organized, I’ll place it just after _update_bullets() to match the order of method calls in the while loop. Here’s the first version of _update_aliens(): def _update_aliens(self): \"\"\"Update the positions of all aliens in the fleet.\"\"\" self.aliens.update() We use the update() method on the aliens group, which calls each alien’s update() method. When you run Alien Invasion now, you should see the fleet move right and disappear off the side of the screen. Creating Settings for Fleet Direction Now we’ll create the settings that will make the fleet move down the screen and to the left when it hits the right edge of the screen. Here’s how to imple- ment this behavior: # Alien settings self.alien_speed = 1.0 self.fleet_drop_speed = 10 # fleet_direction of 1 represents right; -1 represents left. self.fleet_direction = 1 The setting fleet_drop_speed controls how quickly the fleet drops down the screen each time an alien reaches either edge. It’s helpful to separate this speed from the aliens’ horizontal speed so you can adjust the two speeds independently. To implement the setting fleet_direction, we could use a text value, such as 'left' or 'right', but we’d end up with if-elif statements testing for the fleet direction. Instead, because we have only two directions to deal with, let’s use the values 1 and −1, and switch between them each time the fleet changes direction. (Using numbers also makes sense because moving right involves adding to each alien’s x-coordinate value, and moving left involves subtracting from each alien’s x-coordinate value.) Checking Whether an Alien Has Hit the Edge We need a method to check whether an alien is at either edge, and we need to modify update() to allow each alien to move in the appropriate direction. This code is part of the Alien class: def check_edges(self): \"\"\"Return True if alien is at edge of screen.\"\"\" screen_rect = self.screen.get_rect() alien_invasion.py settings.py alien.py Aliens! 267 u if self.rect.right >= screen_rect.right or self.rect.left <= 0: return True def update(self): \"\"\"Move the alien right or left.\"\"\" v self.x += (self.settings.alien_speed * self.settings.fleet_direction) self.rect.x = self.x We can call the new method check_edges() on any alien to see whether it’s at the left or right edge. The alien is at the right edge if the right attri- bute of its rect is greater than or equal to the right attribute of the screen’s rect. It’s at the left edge if its left value is less than or equal to 0 u. We modify the method update() to allow motion to the left or right by multiplying the alien’s speed by the value of fleet_direction v. If fleet _direction is 1, the value of alien_speed will be added to the alien’s current position, moving the alien to the right; if fleet_direction is −1, the value will be subtracted from the alien’s position, moving the alien to the left. Dropping the Fleet and Changing Direction When an alien reaches the edge, the entire fleet needs to drop down and change direction. Therefore, we need to add some code to AlienInvasion because that’s where we’ll check whether any aliens are at the left or right edge. We’ll make this happen by writing the methods _check_fleet_edges() and _change_fleet_direction(), and then modifying _update_aliens(). I’ll put these new methods after _create_alien(), but again the placement of these methods in the class isn’t critical. def _check_fleet_edges(self): \"\"\"Respond appropriately if any aliens have reached an edge.\"\"\" u for alien in self.aliens.sprites(): if alien.check_edges(): v self._change_fleet_direction() break def _change_fleet_direction(self): \"\"\"Drop the entire fleet and change the fleet's direction.\"\"\" for alien in self.aliens.sprites(): w alien.rect.y += self.settings.fleet_drop_speed self.settings.fleet_direction *= -1 In _check_fleet_edges(), we loop through the fleet and call check_edges() on each alien u. If check_edges() returns True, we know an alien is at an edge and the whole fleet needs to change direction; so we call _change_fleet _direction() and break out of the loop v. In _change_fleet_direction(), we loop through all the aliens and drop each one using the setting fleet_drop _speed w; then we change the value of fleet_direction by multiplying its cur- rent value by −1. The line that changes the fleet’s direction isn’t part of the for loop. We want to change each alien’s vertical position, but we only want to change the direction of the fleet once. alien_invasion.py 268 Chapter 13 Here are the changes to _update_aliens(): def _update_aliens(self): \"\"\" Check if the fleet is at an edge, then update the positions of all aliens in the fleet. \"\"\" self._check_fleet_edges() self.aliens.update() We’ve modified the method by calling _check_fleet_edges() before updating each alien’s position. When you run the game now, the fleet should move back and forth between the edges of the screen and drop down every time it hits an edge. Now we can start shooting down aliens and watch for any aliens that hit the ship or reach the bottom of the screen. Try It Yourself 13-3. Raindrops: Find an image of a raindrop and create a grid of raindrops. Make the raindrops fall toward the bottom of the screen until they disappear. 13-4. Steady Rain: Modify your code in Exercise 13-3 so when a row of rain- drops disappears off the bottom of the screen, a new row appears at the top of the screen and begins to fall. Shooting Aliens We’ve built our ship and a fleet of aliens, but when the bullets reach the aliens, they simply pass through because we aren’t checking for collisions. In game programming, collisions happen when game elements overlap. To make the bullets shoot down aliens, we’ll use the method sprite.groupcollide() to look for collisions between members of two groups. Detecting Bullet Collisions We want to know right away when a bullet hits an alien so we can make an alien disappear as soon as it’s hit. To do this, we’ll look for collisions imme- diately after updating the position of all the bullets. The sprite.groupcollide() function compares the rects of each element in one group with the rects of each element in another group. In this case, it compares each bullet’s rect with each alien’s rect and returns a diction- ary containing the bullets and aliens that have collided. Each key in the alien_invasion.py Aliens! 269 dictionary will be a bullet, and the corresponding value will be the alien that was hit. (We’ll also use this dictionary when we implement a scoring system in Chapter 14.) Add the following code to the end of _update_bullets() to check for colli- sions between bullets and aliens: def _update_bullets(self): \"\"\"Update position of bullets and get rid of old bullets.\"\"\" --snip-- # Check for any bullets that have hit aliens. # If so, get rid of the bullet and the alien. collisions = pygame.sprite.groupcollide( self.bullets, self.aliens, True, True) The new code we added compares the positions of all the bullets in self.bullets and all the aliens in self.aliens, and identifies any that overlap. Whenever the rects of a bullet and alien overlap, groupcollide() adds a key- value pair to the dictionary it returns. The two True arguments tell Pygame to delete the bullets and aliens that have collided. (To make a high-powered bullet that can travel to the top of the screen, destroying every alien in its path, you could set the first Boolean argument to False and keep the second Boolean argument set to True. The aliens hit would disappear, but all bullets would stay active until they disappeared off the top of the screen.) When you run Alien Invasion now, aliens you hit should disappear. Figure 13-5 shows a fleet that has been partially shot down. Figure 13-5: We can shoot aliens! alien_invasion.py 270 Chapter 13 Making Larger Bullets for Testing You can test many features of the game simply by running the game. But some features are tedious to test in the normal version of the game. For example, it’s a lot of work to shoot down every alien on the screen multiple times to test whether your code responds to an empty fleet correctly. To test particular features, you can change certain game settings to focus on a particular area. For example, you might shrink the screen so there are fewer aliens to shoot down or increase the bullet speed and give yourself lots of bullets at once. My favorite change for testing Alien Invasion is to use really wide bul- lets that remain active even after they’ve hit an alien (see Figure 13-6). Try setting bullet_width to 300, or even 3000, to see how quickly you can shoot down the fleet! Figure 13-6: Extra-powerful bullets make some aspects of the game easier to test. Changes like these will help you test the game more efficiently and pos- sibly spark ideas for giving players bonus powers. Just remember to restore the settings to normal when you’re finished testing a feature. Repopulating the Fleet One key feature of Alien Invasion is that the aliens are relentless: every time the fleet is destroyed, a new fleet should appear. To make a new fleet of aliens appear after a fleet has been destroyed, we first check whether the aliens group is empty. If it is, we make a call to _create_fleet(). We’ll perform this check at the end of _update_bullets(), because that’s where individual aliens are destroyed. Aliens! 271 def _update_bullets(self): --snip-- u if not self.aliens: # Destroy existing bullets and create new fleet. v self.bullets.empty() self._create_fleet() At u, we check whether the aliens group is empty. An empty group eval- uates to False, so this is a simple way to check whether the group is empty. If it is, we get rid of any existing bullets by using the empty() method, which removes all the remaining sprites from a group v. We also call _create _fleet(), which fills the screen with aliens again. Now a new fleet appears as soon as you destroy the current fleet. Speeding Up the Bullets If you’ve tried firing at the aliens in the game’s current state, you might find that the bullets aren’t traveling at the best speed for gameplay. They might be a little slow on your system or way too fast. At this point, you can modify the settings to make the gameplay interesting and enjoyable on your system. We modify the speed of the bullets by adjusting the value of bullet_speed in settings.py. On my system, I’ll adjust the value of bullet_speed to 1.5, so the bullets travel a little faster: # Bullet settings self.bullet_speed = 1.5 self.bullet_width = 3 --snip-- The best value for this setting depends on your system’s speed, so find a value that works for you. You can adjust other settings as well. Refactoring _update_bullets() Let’s refactor _update_bullets() so it’s not doing so many different tasks. We’ll move the code for dealing with bullet and alien collisions to a sepa- rate method: def _update_bullets(self): --snip-- # Get rid of bullets that have disappeared. for bullet in self.bullets.copy(): if bullet.rect.bottom <= 0: self.bullets.remove(bullet) self._check_bullet_alien_collisions() def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self): \"\"\"Respond to bullet-alien collisions.\"\"\" # Remove any bullets and aliens that have collided. alien_invasion.py settings.py alien_invasion.py 272 Chapter 13 collisions = pygame.sprite.groupcollide( self.bullets, self.aliens, True, True) if not self.aliens: # Destroy existing bullets and create new fleet. self.bullets.empty() self._create_fleet() We’ve created a new method, _check_bullet_alien_collisions(), to look for collisions between bullets and aliens, and to respond appropriately if the entire fleet has been destroyed. Doing so keeps _update_bullets() from growing too long and simplifies further development. Try It Yourself 13-5. Sideways Shooter Part 2: We’ve come a long way since Exercise 12-6, Sideways Shooter. For this exercise, try to develop Sideways Shooter to the same point we’ve brought Alien Invasion to. Add a fleet of aliens, and make them move sideways toward the ship. Or, write code that places aliens at ran- dom positions along the right side of the screen and then sends them toward the ship. Also, write code that makes the aliens disappear when they’re hit. Ending the Game What’s the fun and challenge in a game if you can’t lose? If the player doesn’t shoot down the fleet quickly enough, we’ll have the aliens destroy the ship when they make contact. At the same time, we’ll limit the number of ships a player can use, and we’ll destroy the ship when an alien reaches the bottom of the screen. The game will end when the player has used up all their ships. Detecting Alien and Ship Collisions We’ll start by checking for collisions between aliens and the ship so we can respond appropriately when an alien hits it. We’ll check for alien and ship collisions immediately after updating the position of each alien in"], "answer_snippet": "Detecting collisions helps you define interactions between elements in your games: for example, you can determine when a bullet hits an alien or when the player's ship is hit by an alien."}

Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15]. Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc- tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 2 Background The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence- aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. 2 Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.
